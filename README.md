# CMC Mod Manager
## What
This project is a WIP mod manager for Super Smash Brothers Crusade CMC+ v7(.1.1).
## Features (WIP)
This mod manager works by storing a copy of the basegame and all installed mods seperatly and then merging them in the designated order.

When installing characters, it is likely that some mods will not work properly unless they are able to be copied straight into the CMC folder to install.
